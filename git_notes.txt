1 git feature create kiye, main pehle se tha, (both are local repo)
  made sm changes in feature, and in order to make those changes visible on local main, go to main (git checkout  main) and then "git merge feature".

2. remote repo pe ek branch tha of name "feature"( whuch was created bt Suraj). Mere local repo me feature nam ka ki branch nhi tha. 
   When I run "git checkout feature", new branch got created in my local repo which was identical to the feature branch in the remote repo.

3 . Empety folder cholbe na : tm ek empty folder bnaao apne local repo me and do git status, it will not show

4. Pull krne se saare branch update ho jaate h? Nahi. Hr local repo me jaake pull krna pdega

5. Book1/

6.Everything in local : In feature branch, created a file "thor". Did git checkout main > Tihor also started showing on main (locally).
  Now we again git checkout feature > Did git push. Now we came to main(local)> ls > Thor is no more.

  I think I got a remediation for this : File banaan k baad hm changes commit nahi kr rhe the, jiske kaaran Thor untracked hi reh ja rha tha. To maybe git decide nahi kr pa rha hoga ki isko kon se repo me        rakhna h. So, thor saarebranches display ho rha tha.  ONCE I COMMITED THE CHANGE IN THE FEATURE BRANCH,  THOR  NO LONGER GET DISPLAYED ON OTHER BRANCHES.
